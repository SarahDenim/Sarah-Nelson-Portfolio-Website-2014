      <p class="lead">Graffiti floor is an interactive floor created as part of the subject "Physical Computing and Interaction Design Studio" (DECO3850) at the University of Queensland. It allows users to paint on the ground with their motions as well as discover the use of other gestures and controls. The idea is to provide a fun and engaging experience that cultivates playfulness, discovery, creativity and motion in a casual interactive environment. It is to entertain them for a time, possibly in a place they don't expect to be entertained (such as a walkway or shopping centre). It also has potential for use in many other situations, such as the classroom or an art gallery, childcare centre or dance performance. </p>
      <p class="lead">The project is comprised of a projector and a Kinect 2, and was programmed in C#. A wooden stand is used to secure the projector and Kinect in place, and the floor is made of wooden boards that have been painted white.</p>

      <p class="lead">Listed below are all the features implemented in the final product. We had many more ideas of other features we would have liked to have included, but were unable to due to time and complexity constraints. If the project were to be developed further there is much more that could be done with it. </p>
      <ul class="lead">
        <li>Colours change when the user's hands are clapping or close to each other</li>
        <li>Paint is kept on the floor and the thickness can be changed by holding the left hand up and raising and lowering the right hand</li>
        <li>The circle surrounding users grows and shrinks when they jump</li>
        <li>The icons between users change to a 'friend' symbol when they are close enough to each other</li>
        <li>The song “I believe I can fly” plays when a user holds their arms out like they’re flying</li>
        <li>Party music plays when all users simultaneously hold their hands above their heads</li>
        <li>Icons appear connecting users when two or more people are on the floor. This is meant to know and show their common interests, in order to spark conversation between them and bring them together. When they are close enough, the icon in the middle will change to a 'friend' symbol, a sign that they are now acquainted with each other. The system could detect the user's interests probably through an app that they both have on their phones. This was only symbolic of what could be done in the future with the floor though, it doesn't know or show their actual interests yet.

    </div>
    <div class="whitesection">
      <ul class="lead">
        <li>Users will spend a fair amount of time drawing/exploring various interactions of the floor</li>
        <li>Some users will return to use the floor again (shows they enjoyed it the first time)</li>
        <li>People will be spectating the users on the floor, interested in what is happening</li>
        <li>Spark users’ interest by catching them off guard</li>
        <li>At least some people will work out all the interactions</li>
        <li>User satisfaction for the quality of drawing</li>  
      </ul>
