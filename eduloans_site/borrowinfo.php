	<h2>BORROW</h2>
	<p>Borrowing money can be a harrowing experience. Confusing contracts, pressuring salespeople and cutthroat repayment rates are all things that you can expect when getting loans from a bank that is only in it for the profit. At EduLoans, our goal is to match lenders with borrowers in a way that allows for personal service and lower rates. Our quick and easy loan process allows you to pay off debt while continuing on with your life.</p>

	<p>Borrowing from us is easier than you'd expect. Once you've registered, you are asked to fill out a new loan application. Here you explain what you need the loan for, and fill in relevant information about the loan. Once your application has been submitted, you simply wait! We will email or text you once someone has agreed to your terms and conditions, or has an offer.</p>

	<p>By creating a simple and intuitive interface, we hope to create a loan service that supports students in their path to graduation. From $10 to $1000, whether you need money for rent, your car broke down, or your fridge is looking a little bare, EduLoans is here to help you through what can be a difficult time in life.
