	<h2>LEND</h2>
	<p>EduLoans is not just an investment, but a contribution to the future of the student taking out the loan. For the investor, EduLoans offers great returns with minimal risk.</p>

<p>The process is simple, after you have registered and logged on you'll be able to browse all of our open loan applications. Within each application there will be information about the individual, their assets, and more details required to calculate risk (note: while we do provide links and resources about investing, the decision is ultimately up to you to manage risk). Once you have decided this loan may be a good fit for your portfolio, you can contact the student with your proposed rate. They may decline or accept your terms and conditions, and if they do accept you may then contact them directly to organize the actual transaction and repayment.</p>

<p>As an investment vehicle, eduLoans can be as risky or as safe as you choose, with an equally variable rate of return. Our goal is not to manage your finances, but to provide the opportunities that will allow you to rapidly grow your wealth.
