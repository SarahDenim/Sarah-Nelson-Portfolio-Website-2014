	<h2>HOW IT WORKS</h2>
	<img src="images/how.jpg" alt="How it works" style="width:300px; height:300px; float:right; padding-top: 0px;">

	<p>At its heart, EduLoans is a peer to peer loan service that works by directly matching investors with borrowers. Traditionally, banks will take hefty cuts from each loan it sets up. At EduLoans, we take nothing. This means higher returns for investors, and affordable payments for borrowers.</p>

<p>For example, at a bank you might pay 18% on your loan, however it is not uncommon to see repayments as low as 7% on our website.</p>

<p>The same is true for returns on an investment. Banks will usually pay out a paltry 4% on a typical investment vehicle where our matching system allows for up to 12%.</p>

<p>We walk both investor and borrower through each step, up until the actual matching. Once someone has had their loan application filled, we provide the tools to track the repayment and investment. The only thing we don't deal with is the actual transaction. Our 1 on 1 style of matching allows for more personal loans, which build trust and reduce the possibility of defaulting.</p>

<p>Whether lending or borrowing, we think you'll find EduLoans to be a refreshing loan service alternative.</p>
